Title: Predictive Insights in Healthcare: Advanced Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

Description:
This research focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques for predictive insights in healthcare, specifically in the early detection of diseases. The study implements an advanced disease prediction model that utilizes multiple machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and ensemble learning approaches to enhance accuracy. By integrating these models, the system can analyze user inputs based on general symptoms and provide a probabilistic assessment of disease likelihood.

The model is designed to improve diagnostic efficiency by aggregating predictive outputs from different classifiers through ensemble learning, which enhances reliability and robustness. Additionally, the system incorporates a chatbot interface that assists users by suggesting potential medications and relevant healthcare recommendations based on predicted conditions.

This research aims to bridge the gap between traditional healthcare diagnostics and AI-driven predictive analytics, offering an accessible and intelligent solution for early disease detection. The implementation of this system could significantly aid healthcare professionals and individuals in proactive medical decision-making, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.



This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
